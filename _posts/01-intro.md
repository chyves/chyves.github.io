chyves
----

The name "chyves" is the pluralized, big endian alphabetic increment of `bhyve`. chyves is pronounced like "chives", part of the genus [Allium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allium) scientific classification. The onion is also in the genus Allium.

`chyves` is a bhyve front end manager. `chyves` follows the lead set by `iocage` by storing guest parameters as ZFS user properties. `chyves` is a direct code descendent of `iohyve` and a complete code rewrite was started in April 2016.
