# chyves

`chyves` is a bhyve front-end manager. `chyves` manages type-2 virtualized guests by utilizing hardware virtualization on a base FreeBSD 10.3+ installation. On a base install, only FreeBSD guests can run. However, with the installation of [sysutils/grub2-bhyve](https://www.freshports.org/sysutils/grub2-bhyve) and [sysutils/bhyve-firmware](https://www.freshports.org/sysutils/bhyve-firmware/) from ports or pkg, most other OSes can run as a guest, including Windows. See [DEPENDENCIES section](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chyves/chyves/master/man/chyves.8.html#DEPENDENCIES) in the man page for more information.

`chyves` is targeted for beginners as well as power users. Beginners should find `chyves` relatively easy to use with lots of [documentation](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chyves/chyves/master/man/chyves.8.html) and [demonstrations](#demo). While power users should find utility with features such as true ZFS clones, PCI passthrough, rapid execution against many guests, disk images, and snapshot reverted states on boot/reboot to name a few of the advanced features.

The name 'chyves' is the pluralized, big endian alphabetic increment of `bhyve`. 'chyves' is pronounced like 'chives', part of the [Allium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allium) genus. The onion is also in the Allium genus.
